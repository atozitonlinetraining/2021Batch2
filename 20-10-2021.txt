Finding the locators in Selenium:

id
name
linktext
xpath
cssselector
partial link text
classname
tagname

<input type="text" id="fname" name="firstname"/>

input is htmltag

type="text" is the mandatory attribute

id, name are other attributes

Html Elements:	       HTML Tag	       Mandatory Attribute

Textbox			input		type="text"			

Password		input		type="password"

Radio 			input		type="radio"

Button			input		type="button"

Dropdown - Single 	select		-

Dropdown - Multiple 	select		multipe="true"

Checkbox 		input		type="checkbox"

Link			a		href

Image with Link		img		src

TextArea		textarea	-

Browse			input		type="file"


Questions:

1. Create Sample Registration Page
2. mHTML Tags
3. Mandatory Attributes
4. Element Locators in Selenium
5. Which Element locator is advisable to use and why?
6. Diff b/w linktext and partial link text
7. Diff b/w xpath and css selector
8. Which element locator is advisable for crossbrowser testing?


Xpath:

1. Absolute xpath
2. Relative xpath


1. Absolute xpath:

xpath for first name field:

html/body/input[1]

Note: /(single slash) is used to move from parent node to child node

xpath for multiple select:

html/body/select[2]


2. Relative xpath:

i) By using attributes:

Syntax: //htmltag[@attribute='value']

<select aria-label="Day" name="birthday_day" id="day" title="Day" class="_9407 _5dba _9hk6 _8esg"><option value="1">1</option><option value="2">2</option><option value="3">3</option><option value="4">4</option><option value="5">5</option><option value="6">6</option><option value="7">7</option><option value="8">8</option><option value="9">9</option><option value="10">10</option><option value="11">11</option><option value="12">12</option><option value="13">13</option><option value="14" selected="1">14</option><option value="15">15</option><option value="16">16</option><option value="17">17</option><option value="18">18</option><option value="19">19</option><option value="20">20</option><option value="21">21</option><option value="22">22</option><option value="23">23</option><option value="24">24</option><option value="25">25</option><option value="26">26</option><option value="27">27</option><option value="28">28</option><option value="29">29</option><option value="30">30</option><option value="31">31</option></select>

select -> htmltag

aria-label -> attribute

name -> attribute

id -> attribute

//select[@aria-label='Day']

//select[@name='birthday_day']

//select[@id='day']

Note: While Selecting attributes, we need to select unique attribute


ii) By using text():

Syntax: //htmltag[text()='value']

<div class="mbs _52lq _9bp_ fsl fwb fcb">Create a new account</div>

Note: Always text is not associated with any attribute

//div[text()='Create a new account']

Note: text() matches for the exact pattern 


iii) By using contains(text()):

Syntax: //htmltag[contains(text(),'value')]

//a[contains(text(),'Already')]

Contains text() matches for the part of the text


iv) By using contains(@attribute):

Syntax: //htmltag[contains(@attribute,'value')

Eg: //input[contains(@name,'last')]


simplified way:

1. By using attributes:		  //htmltag[@attribute='value']

2. By using text():		  //htmltag[text()='value']

3. By using contains(text()):	  //htmltag[contains(text(),'value')]

4. By using contains(@attribute): //htmltag[contains(@attribute,'value')]


By using and attributes:

syntax: //htmltag[@attribute1='value' and @attribute2='value' and ---------]

By using or attributes:

syntax: //htmltag[@attribute1='value' or @attribute2='value' or ---------]

Note1: if all the attributes matches exactly for the and attributes

Note2: if either of the attribute match for the or attributes
